# Optical Flow Movement Segmentation 

This project aims to adapt the Lucas & Kanade (1981) and Horn & Schunck (1981) methods for calculating optical flow from consecutive frames of a sequence of images to color images. Also includes segmenting the image by movement based on the optical flow fields calculated in the previous step.

The project involves selecting or producing appropriate test images with various types of movement, including direction, sense, and magnitude. The results will be compared between the two methods and between grayscale and color images.

The project is implemented in Python, using relevant computer vision libraries such as OpenCV. The output will be presented through images showing the objects in motion and a final image highlighting the moving objects against the static background.

> This project will be useful for researchers and developers working in the field of computer vision, particularly in the areas of motion detection and segmentation. The code and results are available on GitHub for others to replicate and build upon.
